    <h1>Welcome to the Club World Cup Draft</h1>
    <p>This draft lets you compete against friends by picking clubs from the Club World Cup groups. Here is how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick one team from every group.</strong></li>
      <li>When your team plays a match, you earn <strong>3 points</strong> for a win or <strong>1 point</strong> for a draw.</li>
      <li>You get bonus points when other players picked the team your club is playing against:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Win:</strong> +3 points for each opposing player who chose the other team.</li>
          <li><strong>Draw:</strong> +1 point for each opposing player who chose the other team.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The total from all of your club's matches decides your final score. The player with the most points after the tournament wins!</p>
